In fact, according to a report by the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, the country records a whopping 51 cases of crime against women every hour, ranging from ‘cruelty against women’ to assault and rape (Verma 2024). In a society which is so deeply plagued by gender violence, it is incredibly important that these women have access to the proper judicial tools at their disposal in order to counteract these harsh conditions, and be able to use these judicial pathways safely, fairly, and successfully. Despite this, in the WPS Index, India receives a score of 2.4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 for “Access to Justice”, ranking somewhere in the middle of other countries in the region–not entirely promising given the harsh conditions women must endure (2024).\nJudicial bias in the legal system is inextricably linked to other forms of gender bias in society as well, and can serve as an interesting unique avenue to view gender bias in a society. However, judicial bias is not only salient in the sphere of violent crimes against women. Reductions in gender bias in society and increase in women entering the workplace has shown to be a key indicator of increased overall productivity in society, resulting in greater economic outcomes (Holland and Ell 2023). A reduction in gender bias towards women in the workforce in the society has been causally related with an increase in GDP, due to an increase in overall productivity and specialized skills (Holland and Ell 2023). Additionally, It is well documented that a stronger, independent judiciary is an indicator of economic growth (Kerry, Lauge N. Skovgaard Poulsen, and Anwar Aridi 2016). This project will attempt to examine these theories in the context of India specifically.\nTwo prominent studies have been conducted regarding the outcomes for women in the judicial system in India. Utilizing over 5 million lower court cases in an 8 year period, although (Ash et al. 2023) found no specific in-group biases from male judges towards female defendants, (jassal2023?) does finds that women are still disadvantaged in the Indian courts through discrimination at several different levels including higher court dismissals and higher accused acquittals. Furthermore, in a judicial case review analysis by (Badoni and Rahman 2022), it was found that judicial stereotyping was clearly evident through language in decisions from several cases concerning sexual violence against women, where women were described in terms of their “provocative clothing,” or of being “habitual to intercourse.” Moreover, it seems there is a general consensus in the public view of a need for judicial reform and improvements in India–in a study by (Garg et al. 2024) found that 54% of people believe that a more proactive role of the Indian judiciary is “required in addressing gender-based discrimination and violence,” and 79% supported “specialized courts/tribunals to handle cases related to women’s rights.” Although judicial reform and bias is an ongoing conversation, only 2 investigations (Ash et al. 2023; Jassal 2023) utilize real case data from India’s lower courts to analyze this issue at the state-level, rather than the national level. Furthermore, the majority of the research in India focuses on qualitative reviews of case laws and decisions, rather than outcomes. My project aims to fill this gap in the literature by addressing outcomes for women using state level panel data.\nAccess to justice is recognized globally as a basic human right. Indeed Articles 5 through 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights lay out the scope of this right to justice, and outline the rights to fair trials and punishments (cite). As Sandefeur highlights, access to justice can both expose and exacerbate societal inequalities. Furthermore, as UN Women highlights, women are usually the poorest and most marginalized parts of society, and often lack agency, and more robust judicial institutions create foundations for women to “assert and claim their social, economic, cultural, political and civil rights (UN Women). The courts have long been an avenue through which marginalized groups can access rights that have been denied to them by society, or to gain equal footing with other segments of society. Therefore, the preservation of a fair and just judicial system is extremely important, and especially important for women, especially in a country such as India, where, as I have previously established, there is such a large proliferation of gender based violence. Furthermore, as I have also established, access to justice is often better for society overall economically. I aim to add on to the research in this field by zooming in on India specifically to examine these trends.\nTo address these issues, I will examine the question: On average, do states in India with lower levels of judicial bias towards women in the lower courts of the Indian judiciary display lower GDP levels?\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n2024.

    "text": "Data\nTo explore my hypothesis, I will use data from 81 million district court cases in India from 2010 - 2010, which was scraped from an online repository (Indian e-Courts platform) that covers 7000+ district courts in India. The original e-courts data includes essential dates, petitioner and respondent names, the relevant legal states, and the final disposition. This data was processed and cleaned by (insert researchers), who additionally used a Long Short-Term Memory model to assign male/female indicators to the defendant records based on the names, which were then anonymized. The cleaned and updated data was taken from the Development Data Lab’s Judicial Data Portal.\nThe first variable of interest is the difference in the acquittal rate for male and female defendants. This was generated by aggregating the cases that were coded for a disposition of ‘acquittal’ to the state level. The female acquittal rate was then subtracted from the male acquittal rate in order to create a difference in acquittal rate variable. The variable is positive if there was a greater male acquittal rate, and negative if there was a greater female acquittal rate. The unit is a ‘difference in rate,’ and the unit of analysis is at the state level. It is important to note that the final dataset scraped from the e-courts platform includes acquittal rate data from 28 states and 1 union territory in India. 4 union territories were excluded from the analysis, because they either did not have sufficient GDP panel data available (as was the case in Diu and Daman, Dadra Nagar Haveli, and Ladakh), or due to an active ongoing boundary dispute (as was the case in Jammu and Kashmir).\n2 other variables were generated using the Indian e-Courts data. The first was the difference in the dismissal rate for female and male defendants, which was generated using similar steps as above, using cases where the disposition was a dismissal. Similarly, the difference in the conviction rate for female and male defendants was also generated. The second dataset that was used was Gross State Domestic Product panel data, from which I am using the GDP variable. This data was taken from the Government of India Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, and is measured in Crores (10 millions) of Indian Rupees. The level of analysis is the state level, and the data spans from 2011 - 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Summary Statistics for Key Variables\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Variable\n      n\n      mean\n      sd\n      median\n      min\n      max\n      range\n      se\n    \n  \n  \n    diff_acquittal\n224\n2.03\n3.16\n1.39\n-7.90\n13.03\n20.93\n0.21\n    diff_dismissal\n224\n-4.36\n4.05\n-3.18\n-17.25\n4.77\n22.02\n0.27\n    diff_conviction\n224\n1.22\n1.88\n0.61\n-6.34\n10.18\n16.52\n0.13\n    GDP\n350\n607560.80\n611561.17\n435990.67\n7258.69\n3108021.87\n3100763.18\n32689.32"

Population growth rates may have a negative affect on both judicial bias and GDP. An increase in population growth rate may cause a rapidly increasing population in states, which may put a strain on that state’s resources.It could lead to increased unemployment, and put pressure on infrastructure and social services, potentially hindering economic growth. Furthermore, in the case of judicial bias, higher population growth can lead to an increase in legal cases, putting pressure on the judicial system to handle them efficiently. Judicial systems may struggle to allocate resources equitably in regions experiencing rapid population growth, leading to disparities in access to justice and potentially exacerbating biases.\nThis population growth rate will be taken from the Reserve Bank of India’s Handbook of Statistics on Indian States. The years covered in the data are 2011 - 2020 and the unit of analysis is at the state level."

    "text": "Limitations\nOne potential unobserved confounder is the composition of the cases. For example, it is possible that women are being charged with lower severity crimes, and are therefore seeing their cases dismissed, or seeing higher rates of acquittal as a result of them. Unfortunately, the aggregated data does not indicate the type of case or allegation the defendant was facing. In future extensions of this, it would be important to examine these.\nPotential unobserved confounders include political stability (political stability may lead to both a more fair judicial system and may lead to increased economic growth), income inequality (which may affect access to the legal system among disadvantaged groups, and inequality tends to discourage economic growth.)\nOne of the threats to interpreting this as a causal relationship is reverse causality, as it is possible that a higher GDP can lead to improvements in the legal system, such as legal training and the expansion of legal access, which may lead to lower gender and bias and a smaller difference in acquittal rates between men and women. Therefore, it is difficult to prescribe the direction of the causality.\nFurthermore, there are many possible unobserved covariates and confounders due to a lack of readily available panel data for the states over the time period that the judicial bias data is available. Variables such as female labor force participation or other measures of growth would be useful in probing these results further, but are only available at the national level, rather than the state level. Furthermore, there are variables that jointly determine both acquittal rates and GDP which are not included in the data. A more comprehensive data set would be required for a more robust analysis."

    "text": "Empirical Extension Plan\nIn order to add credibility to my inference, I will conduct the analysis I conducted above on two different measures of judicial bias in addition to the primary “Differences in acquittal rates” variable. First, I will use the difference in dismissal rates, once again, controlling for population growth so that I can rule it out as a potential con-founder. I will then repeat the same process with the difference in conviction rates, another measure of judicial bias.\n\nRegression Model 2\n\\[\n\\text{GDP} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Dismissal Rate Difference} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{Population Growth} + \\varepsilon \\\n\\]\n\n\nRegression Model 3\n\\[\n\\text{GDP} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Conviction Rate Difference} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{Population Growth} + \\varepsilon \\\n\\] Furthermore, because judicial bias is a less explored measure of gender bias in society, further potential extensions would be to observe how robust judicial bias is as a measure of gender equality in larger Indian society by testing the relationship between GDP and two well documented measures of gender status in society. Although once again, there was limited panel data readily available online for the state level, two variables that can be included are the maternal mortality ratio, the total fertility rate, and the state-wise unemployment rate. Consistent with the previously established theories, I would expect that a decrease in these three variables is also correlated with a higher GDP.\nThe maternal mortality ratio is defined as the (number of maternal deaths / number of live births) x100000. The total fertility rate is defined as the average number of children expected to be born to a woman over her lifetime. The state-wise female unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed females as a percentage of the labor force. All three of these variables were sourced from the Reserve Bank of India’s Handbook on Indian States and span 2011 - 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Summary Statistics for Empirical Extension Variables\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Variable\n      n\n      mean\n      sd\n      median\n      min\n      max\n      range\n      se\n    \n  \n  \n    Maternal Mortality Ratio\n122\n124.66\n64.95\n110.0\n19.0\n328.0\n309.0\n5.88\n    Total Fertility Rate\n204\n2.12\n0.53\n1.9\n1.4\n3.6\n2.2\n0.04\n    Female Unemployment Rate\n194\n101.62\n64.95\n89.5\n17.0\n564.0\n547.0\n4.66\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{GDP} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\text{Maternal Mortality Ratio} +  \\varepsilon \\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{GDP} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\text{Total Fertility Rate} +  \\varepsilon \\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{GDP} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times \\text{Female Unemployment Rate} +  \\varepsilon \\\n\\]"

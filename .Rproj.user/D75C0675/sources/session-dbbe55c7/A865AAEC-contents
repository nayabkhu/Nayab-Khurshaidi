# Introduction

India, a country rife with gender-related violence, ranks 128th of 177 countries in the Women, Peace and Security Index (WPS) curated by Georgetown, based on measures of inclusion, justice, and security in society @GIWPS_2024. In fact, according to a report by the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, the country records a whopping 51 cases of crime against women every hour, ranging from ‘cruelty against women’ to assault and rape @Verma_2024. In a society which is so deeply plagued by gender violence, it is incredibly important that these women have access to the proper judicial tools at their disposal in order to counteract these harsh conditions, and be able to use these judicial pathways safely, fairly, and successfully.

In the WPS Index, India receives a score of 2.4 on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 for “Access to Justice”, ranking somewhere in the middle of other countries in the region–not entirely promising given the harsh conditions women must endure @GIWPS_2024.

Two prominent studies have been conducted regarding the outcomes for women in the judicial system in India. Utilizing over 5 million lower court cases in an 8 year period, although @casesgroup found no specific in-group biases from male judges towards female defendants, @jassal2023does finds that women are still disadvantaged in the Indian courts through discrimination at several different levels including higher court dismissals and higher accused acquittals (@casesgroup)(@jassal2023does). Furthermore, in a judicial case review analysis by @badonijudicial, it was found that judicial stereotyping was clearly evident through language in decisions from several cases concerning sexual violence against women, where women were described in terms of their “provocative clothing,” or of being “habitual to intercourse. @badonijudicial ” Furthermore, it seems there is a general consensus in the public view of a need for judicial reform and improvements in India–in a study by @garg2024role found that 54% of people believe that a more proactive role of the Indian judiciary is “required in addressing gender-based discrimination and violence,” and 79% supported “specialized courts/tribunals to handle cases related to women’s rights.” @garg2024role Although judicial reform and bias is an ongoing conversation, only 2 investigations @casesgroup @jassal2023does utilize real case data from India’s lower courts to analyze this issue at the state-level, rather than the national level. Furthermore, the majority of the research in India focuses on qualitative reviews of case laws and decisions, rather than outcomes. My project aims to fill this gap in the literature by addressing outcomes for women using state level panel data.

Judicial bias in the legal system is inextricably linked to other forms of gender bias in society, and can serve as an interesting unique avenue to view gender bias in a society. However, judicial bias is not only salient in the sphere of violent crimes against women. Reductions in gender bias in society and increase in women entering the workplace has shown to be a key indicator of increased overall productivity in society, resulting in greater economic outcomes @Holland_Ell_2023.

To address these issues, I will examine the question:

On average, do states in India with lower levels of judicial bias towards women in the lower courts of the Indian judiciary display lower GDP levels?

# Hypothesis

I predict that on average, lower judicial biases in states in India (measured through differences in acquittal rates between men and women) will result in higher GDP’s in those states, displaying an inverse relationship.

A reduction in gender bias towards women in the workforce in the society has been causally related with an increase in GDP, due to an increase in overall productivity and specialized skills @Holland_Ell_2023. Additionally, It is well documented that a stronger, independent judiciary is an indicator of economic growth @Kerry_Lauge. Furthermore, a study that used panel data from 73 countries across world regions found that access to justice is a significant positive determinant of economic growth within countries @deseau2019access. Additionally, the researchers hypothesized that the impact of access to justice could possibly be stronger in less developed countries, such as India @deseau2019access. I predict, therefore, that lower judicial biases will result in an increased ability of women to have equal opportunity and legal protection, resulting in a greater participation in the workforce, an increase in the utilization of human capital, and resulting greater economic prosperity and outcomes in those states, as measured through GDP.

# Data

1.  Variable 1: Difference in Acquittal Rate for Female and Male Defendants

    -   Variable Creation: Cases were coded for acquittals and aggregated to the state level to generate the percent of cases which resulted in acquittals for both female and male defendants. The female acquittal rate was then subtracted from the male acquittal rate in order to create a difference in acquittal rate variable. The variable is negative if there was a greater male acquittal rate, and negative if there was a greater female acquittal rate. 

    -   Source: [Development Data Lab Judicial Data Portal](https://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-data)

    -   Unit: Difference in Rate 

    -   Level of Analysis: State - The final, cleaned dataset includes acquittal rate data from 28 states and 1 union territory in India. 4 Union Territories were excluded from the analysis, because they either did not have sufficient GDP panel data (Diu and Daman, Dadra Nagar Haveli, and Ladakh) available, or due to ongoing boundary conflict (Jammu and Kashmir).

    -   Sample: This variable was generated from 81 million district court cases from 2010 - 2018, which the original researchers constructed by scraping case records from an online repository ([Indian e-Courts platform](https://districts.ecourts.gov.in/)) covering 7000+ district courts in India. The original e-courts data includes essential dates, petitioner and respondent names, the relevant legal statues, and the final disposition. The original researchers than used a Long Short-Term Memory model in order to assign male/female indicators to the cases based on the names, which were then anonymized.  

2.  Variable 2: Difference in Dismissal Rate for Female and Male Defendants 

    -   Variable Creation: Cases were coded for dismissals and aggregated to the state level to generate the percent of cases which resulted in dismissals for both female and male defendants. The female dismissal rate was then subtracted from the male dismissal rate in order to create a difference in dismissal rate variable. The variable is negative if there was a greater male dismissal rate, and negative if there was a greater female dismissal rate.

3.  Variable 3: Difference in Conviction Rate for Female and Male Defendants 

    -   Variable Creation: Cases were coded for convictions and aggregated to the state level to generate the percent of cases which resulted in convictions for both female and male defendants. The female conviction rate was then subtracted from the male conviction rate in order to create a difference in conviction rate variable. The variable is negative if there was a greater male conviction rate, and negative if there was a greater female conviction rate.

plot_acquittal
```

This plot shows that the majority of states have higher acquittal rates for men than women, as the majority of data points are concentrated on the right side of the graph. On this side of the graph, there appears to be a negative relationship between the difference in acquittal rates and GDP, meaning that areas with more equal acquittal rates tend to display a higher GDP. This would support my hypothesis, as it would predict that lower judicial bias is indicative of economic growth.

```{r}
#| warning: false
plot_dismissal
```

This plot shows that the majority of states have higher dismissal rates for women than men, as the majority of data points are concentrated on the left side of the graph. On this side of the graph, there appears to be a slight positive relationship between the difference in dismissal rates and GDP, meaning that areas with more equal dismissal rates tend to display a higher GDP. This would support my hypothesis, as it would predict that lower judicial bias is indicative of economic growth.

```{r}
#| warning: false
plot_conviction
```

This plot shows that the majority of states have higher conviction rates for men than women, as the majority of data points are concentrated on the right side of the graph. On this side of the graph, there appears to be a slight positive relationship between the difference in conviction rates and GDP, meaning that areas with more disparate conviction rates tend to display a higher GDP. This would not support my hypothesis. However, in this plot, unlike the others, we can see that a large number of data points are closer to 0 - meaning that conviction rates are usually more equal for men and women compared to other measures.

# Research Design

## Main Regression Model

$$
\text{GDP} = \alpha + \beta \times \text{Acquittal Rate Difference} + \varepsilon \
$$\

One co-variate that I plan on including is the population growth rate. Population growth rates may have a negative affect on both judicial bias and GDP. An increase in population growth rate may cause a rapidly increasingly population in states, which may put a strain on that state's resources.It could lead to increased unemployment, and put pressure on infrastructure and social services, potentially hindering economic growth. Furthermore, in the case of judicial bias, higher population growth can lead to an increase in legal cases, putting pressure on the judicial system to handle them efficiently. Judicial systems may struggle to allocate resources equitably in regions experiencing rapid population growth, leading to disparities in access to justice and potentially exacerbating biases.

Co-variate Variable: State-wise Natural Population Growth Rate

-   Years available: 2011 - 2020

-   Unit of Analysis: State

-   Source: [Reserve Bank of India, Handbook of Statistics on Indian States](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States)

Potential unobserved con-founders include political stability (political stability may lead to both a more fair judicial system and may lead to increased economic growth), income inequality (which may affect access to the legal system among disadvantaged groups, and inequality tends to discourage economic growth.)

One of the threats to interpreting this as a causal relationship is reverse causality, as it is possible that a higher GDP can lead to improvements in the legal system, such as legal training and the expansion of legal access, which may lead to lower gender and bias and a smaller difference in acquittal rates between men and women. Therefore, it is difficult to prescribe the direction of the causality.

Furthermore, there are many possible unobserved co-variates and con-fouders due to a lack of readily available panel data for the states over the time period that I have judicial bias data. Furthermore, there are variables that jointly determine both acquittal rates and GDP which are not included in the data. A more comprehensive data set would be required for a more robust analysis.

## Empirical Extension

In order to add credibility to my inference, I will conduct the analysis I conducted above on two different measures of judicial bias in addition to the primary "Differences in acquittal rates" variable. First. I will use the difference in dismissal rates, once again, controlling for population growth so that I can rule it out as a potential con-founder. I will then repeat the same process with the difference in conviction rates, another measure of judicial bias.

### Regression Model 2

$$
\text{GDP} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{Dismissal Rate Difference} + \beta_2 \times \text{Population Growth} + \varepsilon \
$$

### Regression Model 3

$$
\text{GDP} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times \text{Conviction Rate Difference} + \beta_2 \times \text{Population Growth} + \varepsilon \
$$

### Additional Measures of Gender Bias 

Becuase judicial bias is a less explored measure of gender bias in society, further potential extensions would be to observe how robust judicial bias is as a measure of gender equality in larger Indian society by testing the relationship between GDP and two well documented measures of gender status in society. Although once again, there was limited panel data readily available online for the state level, two variables that can be included are:
